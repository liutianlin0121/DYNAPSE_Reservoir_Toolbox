The repository contains tools for doing reservoir computing on Dynap-se.

Requirement: one needs to install DYNAPSETools (https://github.com/sanfans/DYNAPSETools) developed by Roberto Cattaneo

One can also try out the Reservoir Transfer computational scheme with Brian simulation (and without the Dynap-se hardware): https://github.com/he-xu/ReservoirTransfer
